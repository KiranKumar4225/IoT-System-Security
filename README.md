# IoT-System-Security

As part of the MSc Cyber security course, I have completed this module and its coursework has been uploaded. The description of this module is provided below.

The aim of the module is to develop a deep understanding of security in Internet of things system. This module is relevant to a wide range of field, encompassing many concepts and methodologies related to cyber-physical systems, smart devices, sensors and actuators, network and wireless security, lightweight cryptography, data loss detection and prevention, and risk analysis. This module will allow students to act professionally in the design, analysis, implementation, and reporting of enhance IoT system, security strategies, and application development. 

On successful completion of this module students will: 
1) Have good understanding of basic principles of IoT systems security design.
2) Be able to identify risks related to both the hardware and software.
3) Develop analytical skills related the key security principles and practical skills that may 
be used to mitigate risks in IoT.
